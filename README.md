# Project Overview
This project is a Python API that demonstrates some of the capabilities of Couchbase Server.  It was built for Developer track of the Couchbase NoSQL Summit and works in conjunction with a web application (Github repository [here](https://github.com/thejcfactor/cb-dev-days-web)).  The API is built using the Couchbase 3.x Python SDK (SDK documentation [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/python-sdk/current/hello-world/start-using-sdk.html)).  The project contains a handful of labs that allow participants to build out the functionality of the simple e-commerce web application.  The details of each lab are listed below.

>:exclamation:**IMPORTANT**:exclamation:<br> Please be sure to read sections labeled IMPORTANT, REMEMBER, NOTES and DOCUMENTATION as the section will contain important information related to setup and/or the labs.


# Prerequisites

1. *Git*
    - Used to clone code repositories (can use *Git Bash* on Windows machines).
2. *Docker*
    - *Docker* containers have been published for the API and web UI projects.  The labs assume participants are using the published containers.  However, all of the code can be run locally. 

>**NOTE:** If you want to run the code locally, *Python* needs to be installed.  You do not need to install *Docker* if running code locally.

# Labs
The labs are split up into different versions based on the participant's operating system.  

>:exclamation:**IMPORTANT**:exclamation:<br>If using *Docker* for *Windows* and running *Linux* containers, using the labs for *MacOS*/*Linux* should suffice.  The *Windows* labs are geared towards participants running *Windows* wanting to run the code locally and not use *Docker*.

:exclamation: Labs are under construction... :exclamation:
